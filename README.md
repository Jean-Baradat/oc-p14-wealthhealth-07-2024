# Welcome aboard, captain

This project is the 14th in the OpenClassrooms training "Faites passer une librairie jQuery vers React". The goal is to completely redesign the HRnet application, which is intended for managing employee records. The application, originally in jQuery, will be converted to React JS. Subsequently, a JS package was developed in-house (find the package [here](https://jean-baradat.github.io/oc-p14--jean_rc-dialog-10-2024/)) and integrated into the new version of HRnet.
